___
**Computer-assisted drug discovery**

The exploration of the inhibition potential of molecules on PKM2 and ERK2 using computational methods, focusing on molecular descriptor calculation. Molecular structures were represented by SMILES strings and processed using RDKit to compute various descriptors.
___
